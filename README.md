# EnglishProject
A project for my English Lessons - application with GUI. Crocodile is a game where The participants have to show 
and guess words or expressions with the help of gestures, movements and facial expressions. My applictaion shows a random picture and word, and time.
You can set up your custom time for guessing the word.
